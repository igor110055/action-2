<p>The first major difference is the novel-writing storyline which is almost completely different between the novels and the anime. From my memory wich is awful I dont remember anything in the anime at all related to these events or anything leading up. 4 The anime covered less material than the manga. The LN has the most details that were skipped out by the Anime and the adaptation. Specific plot points later on are influenced by the number of students in class. Is it anime or manga.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-japanese-and-wider-asia-the-manga-which-is-the-japanese-version-of-comics-and-print-cartoons-turned-into">In the Japanese and wider Asia the manga which is the Japanese version of comics and print cartoons turned into.</h3><p>Ive not read much but theres already tons of major differences. The opening dialogue in the novel Introduction between the two students goes deeper into the Misaki legend. Misaki and Mei are pushed back. The anime covers until volume 3 while the manga covers until volume 5. Is it anime or manga. Even considering Our Last Crusade which has volumes not that big.</p>

<p>The volumes were rushed 4 volumes in 12 episodes is not near enough. From my memory wich is awful I dont remember anything in the anime at all related to these events or anything leading up. In the novels the woman who was Kirinos editor in the anime is actually a failed novelist herself who steals Kirinos work and passes it off as her own. The volumes were rushed 4 volumes in 12 episodes is not near enough. So yeah the adaptation was bad light novel really really superior.</p>

The volumes were rushed 4 volumes in 12 episodes is not near enough.</p>

<p>The volumes were rushed 4 volumes in 12 episodes is not near enough. The anime was meh. The manga is only an adaptation of the Light Novels much like the anime is and its by far not as faithful as the anime and even that took someunexpected plot points into the storyline. Is it anime or manga. In the novels the woman who was Kirinos editor in the anime is actually a failed novelist herself who steals Kirinos work and passes it off as her own.</p>
