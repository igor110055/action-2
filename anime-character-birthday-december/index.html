<p>30 with over 230 characters listed. Held a survey from dec. The anime birthday calendar it all started some years ago with a future gpx cyber formula artbook that listed the characters� birthdates. Tossing out a few odd data points for the nonexistent dates february 30, april 31, and november 31, it’s may 26, with only 42 characters born that day, iruka umino (naruto), akira ohkouchi (negima), and kohza (one piece) among them.joining may 26 at the bottom of the actually possible birthday list are december 11 (43 birthdays) and january 26 (49). Beginning with the original nintendo ds�s birthday function, all pokémon games have, so far, had something inclusive for just this function, the most well known of which is the appearance of diamond dust, wherein on junichi masuda�s birthday (january 12), it will appear in snowpoint city.</p>
