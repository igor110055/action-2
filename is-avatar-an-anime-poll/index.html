<p>Some say anime has to be made in japan for japan to be anime. This is why you’ll hear people describe the web series rwby (made by american production company, rooster teeth) as an american anime. One of the many reasons why we love anime so much are the countless beautiful characters. You can even use your xbox original avatar as an alter ego. The next poll is going to be a celebration because i�m 1/4 of the way to 100 so don�t miss it!</p>

<p>Legend of korra is not in this. Use the xbox avatar editor to create your digital identity on xbox live: Not exactly an anime, but i know some people start with avatar and legend of korra before getting into anime so i decided to include it. You can acknowledge the nod to anime, but you can’t outright call it anime. There’s no way aang is beating gajeel without the avatar state, and even then.</p>

<p>So this will be a poll of which characters from avatar the last airbender you ship, and how it compares to what other people think. The page put out a poll to get a better feel of the more popular ship. One of the many reasons why we love anime so much are the countless beautiful characters. Katara’s 10 most badass moments, ranked ranking the two shows against each other is no simple task, as. Even bora would be a major challenge to base aang by anime feats.</p>
