<p>Crunchyroll is quite effective as users can easily navigate through the pages tosearch favourite anime and can even be used in devices such as iphone, smartphones, ps4 and xbox360. If you have netlfix then thats a good choice since you have a lot of options to how you want to watch it( dub/sub). You may browse the addon’s content material by means of genre, date added, and recently. I use crunchyroll and hulu. I’ll tell you for both naruto and naruto shippuden, dub and sub.</p>
