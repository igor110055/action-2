<p>This color can be deceiving, as a character with this hair color may be far from normal. The selections only/randomise option in the detailed menu will let you choose the traits yourself, or randomly select optional features for the character. Fill it in with one solid color just like the body. When coloring the hair once again leave the highlight area white if drawing on paper. Choose simple or detailed for basic or more inclusive results respectively.</p>
