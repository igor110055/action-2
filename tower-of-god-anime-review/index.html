Now, however, rachel is set on climbing the tower, and she is willing to leave bam behind to do so. Rachel taught him to speak, read, play games, everything. It has been confirmed by crunchyroll that the tower of god anime will be 13 episodes long.</p>

<p>I love a good dark fantasy and while i haven’t seen any of the source material, i had heard good things about the story. Read reviews on the anime kami no tou (tower of god) on myanimelist, the internet�s largest anime database. Helps you decide whether to watch this anime series or not. Since the anime is only 13 episodes, every second of plot development was critical to contributing to the. Remember, if tower of god is successful, other webtoons can possibly receive anime, which means more money for them.</p>

<p>Reach the top, and everything will be yours. Due to japanese translation, his name is actually yoru in the anime, but since i know him as bam, that will be what i call him. The tower of god is an unforgiving place, but make it to the top and your dreams will come true. As ever, when any anime dares to look a bit different, i read a few complaints about the art and animation looking cheap or unfinished. A world set in middle ages where exams and trials are a priority have already been explored by many animes.</p>
