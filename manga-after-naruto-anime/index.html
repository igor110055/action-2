<p>Dude who likes eating brains. Albert on october 27, 2016: His final version, which debuted in weekly shonen jump in 1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in the world. * if you are planning on reading the manga i would start at the end of chapter 15.

The anime is nowhere near the quality of the artwork in the manga, it’s much flabbier in terms of storytelling and is simply nowhere near as good.</p>

Naruto part 1 anime was really good (skip all filler after 135 ofc) shippuden was pretty bad, many parts are quite unwatchable with the filler and pacing (also the story in part 2 had a lot of issues but that�s more of kishimoto�s fault). Anime/manga and naruto crossover fanfiction archive with over 28 stories.
