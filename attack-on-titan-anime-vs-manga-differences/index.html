<p>Answer 1 of 5. By which I mean that its content thats better animated than it is in the manga. Well theyre making an Attack on Titan movie. Answer 1 of 5. What is the difference between the attack on Titan manga and anime.</p>

<p>There isnt a drastic difference between the two except of course that one is an anime and one is a manga. Should i just save the money and time and wait until after season 2 ends before reading the manga. Mikasa and Eren are a couple as opposed to adopted siblings. Because it had included many original concepts the number of differences have been slightly minimized for the sake of fitting details onto one page. The painfully awkward Mikasa of the film as played by Kiku Mizuhara is really very different from the cool and confident Mikasa of the anime.</p>

<p>The information is based on research by reviewing the anime and s. While most readers loved the final chapter some fans arent exactly happy with the ending. This character was really very poorly portrayed in the film even in the second act when she was already supposed to be an elite soldier.
