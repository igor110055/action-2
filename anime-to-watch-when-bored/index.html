<p>On myanimelist, and join in the discussion on the largest online anime and manga database in the world! There is a police force, inter solar. An awesome dose of comedy mixed with great action and adventure. While yaoi/shounen ai anime is. Some series just work better if you watch a bunch of episodes in a row.</p>

<p>As well as have fun with nerve wracking plot twists. Yeah, but before we could even reach that episode, we could lose interest in continuing to watch the series. If you are a newbie to anime, cowboy bebop is the best anime to watch. (i say it coz u didn�t mention anything about them) level 1. Sit back, watch, enjoy, and laugh till you drop!</p>
