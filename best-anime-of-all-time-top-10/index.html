In the top spot of the best harem anime of all time is a playful subversion of the genre. It is a masterwork that should justly rank among the best works of television of all time, let alone anime Unlike the american cartoons that are mostly in the action/adventure and comedy genre, the anime shows dwell into much serious issues often focusing on including more depth and deeper meaning to the story.</p>

<p>In the top spot of the best harem anime of all time is a playful subversion of the genre. Some of the qualifying factors taken into consideration for a series being deemed great are, entertainment value, popularity, lasting appeal, quality of writing, originality and significance to the medium of anime. One piece(i haven�t watched all of it only around 50 eps and some of the later arcs, but i�ve read the manga and watched most of the recap movies) fma:b There is a high standard for the special animation style within the studio and they have released classic after classic. Mind games, strategies, twists, brain shocks, etc.</p>

<p>But from what i have watched these would have to be my top ten. When it comes to favorite anime list, everybody has different anime on their list which is according to their interests in the genre. Top 10 most overpowered/op protagonists in anime [updated] top 10 chinese anime [updated best recommendations] top 10 supernatural romance. Top 10 anime with characters who defy gender norms [best recommendations]. Really wish the writer gets better and finishes the whole thing.</p>

<p>It is a clear picture of society and the different perspectives of crime and exploration. This is the anime theme and soundtrack top ten list though, so coincidentally the music here is attached to cr¿me of the crop. Either due to critical/popular acclaim, or historical significance, these movies represent the best of anime. Some anime have multiple opening themes throughout their shows but this list will only include one entry per series. And also if we are talking about anime duos, gon and killua are number one for sure.</p>
