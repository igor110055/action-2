<p>It is just a vile nightmare from the beginning to the end. The anime was about a young girl who became part of a freak show and ritually abused and humiliated until she met an ally in the form of a mystical dwarf magician. It was banned out right in several countries and iirc several anime critics have named it the second worst anime ever made partly on it being so immorally irrepressible, and also partly because it is terrible. It�s not a particularly well told story. Well then that�s your opinion.</p>
