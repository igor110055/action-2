<p>In this anime you have a female and male protagonist. Like Attack on Titan AOT Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress is a dark fantasy action. Since the world is overrun with Ghouls and the main character becomes a ghoul himself. Answer 1 of 6. Death Note - this is an older anime and manga series but I like it.</p>

<p>It follows Eren Yeager who commits to eliminate. Unlike titans ghouls look like normal human being except they eat human flesh just like titans. Attack on Titan - Has the dark fantasy and lots of blood. However the main difference between this anime and AOT is that the enemies are ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul instead of titans. Future Diary is nothing like Attack on Titan.</p>
