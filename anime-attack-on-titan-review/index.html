<p>As such my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. Attack on Titan Anime Review Features. The voicing of the characters is excellent. Centuries ago giant humans called Titans appeared seemingly out of nowhere and like to eat humans for no reason. Characters are well thought-out developed and voiced flawlessly.</p>

<p>Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. But while static scenes are given over to still shots and to speed lines the scenes in which. We see it with the NBA and LeBron James and we see it with the NFL and Patrick Mahomes. And that Eren being with Mikasa in chapter 138 was another failed timeline as was chapter 139. However the largest titan humanity has ever seen has destroyed the walls and all hell breaks lose.</p>
