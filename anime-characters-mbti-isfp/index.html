<p>Making up only 4% of the population, infps are very quiet yet hopeful for a better future. While there is no isfp anime test, if you want to know whether you are an isfp, take the mbti 16 personalities test to find out and after that you may check out websites like personality database to figure out which anime characters fit the isfp personality like you.

These are also infp anime characters.</p>
