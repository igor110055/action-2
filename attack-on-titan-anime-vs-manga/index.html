Should i just save the money and time and wait until after season 2 ends before reading the manga. Attack on Titan features some of the most brutal deaths including that of Carla Yeager. It makes me question if the extra reveals in the manga is worth it.</p>

<p>Manga side-by-side comparison Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 - Episode 5Chapter 81 Video spoiler. In the case of Carlas death in Attack on Titan it was the manga that went the extra mile. The Attack on Titan Final Volume Commemorative. Answer 1 of 5. The series has a decently large cast along with complex politics and a complicated setting and its easy to miss the smaller details when watching the anime.</p>

<p>Most would think the anime would be more graphic than the manga. Yes the manga is more detailed but the anime literally covers an entire volume in 1 episode. The anime might condense these future scenes to match how the previous scenes were adapted so tbh just read all 139 chapters in the manga. Answer 1 of 3. Heres how this scene in the anime differs from the manga.</p>

<p>The Attack on Titan Final Volume Commemorative. Most would think the anime would be more graphic than the manga. The anime is just a few months away from airing the first episode of the concluding part. The first two seasons of the anime are pretty faithful to the manga but the third season not only have many changes but also miss a lot st. The representation of the mindless titans is very well done in the anime and the editing behind the individual titan is quite noticeable as nearly all of them looks.</p>
