<p>Yoonbum, a scrawny quiet boy, has a crush on one of the most popular and handsome guys in school, sangwoo. Our first protagonist, yoonbum, is a man in his late twenties who stalks his crush oh sangwoo, who he met in the military and later during his time in college. Yes they did the yaoi but that does not mean that the relationship is cute or that sangwoo loves yoonbum.

<p>One day, with yoonbum�s obsession towards sangwoo reaching its peak, yoonbum decides to enter sangwoo�s home yoonbum stories refine by tag: Oh sangwoo is the second main character of killing stalking, the primary antagonist. But what he saw inside was not the sangwoo he had dreamed of. A very hot murderer with mommy issues👍 a term coined by donald trump on his show the apprentice even though bosses used it all the time before.now anyone who watched five minutes of it thinks it�s the absolute shit and uses it to say you suck! or loser! She tried to abort him several times.</p>
