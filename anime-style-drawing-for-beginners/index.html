<p>It’s very difficult for beginners to find textbooks. The style is both beautiful and fairly simple to learn, with a lot of room for creativity and personal touches, making it a favorite for both young and old. Living in japan for two years gave me an appreciation for all things anime , and i’m thrilled that it’s finally becoming so popular here! This guide is an introduction to the basics of drawing with a focus on the anime and manga style. Anime style drawings are increasingly popular as japanese manga (comics) and anime.</p>
